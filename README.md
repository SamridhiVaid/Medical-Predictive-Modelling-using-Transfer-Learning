# Medical-Predictive-Modelling-using-Transfer-Learning
Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of M.Sc

1.	Finetuning.py: This contains the code for running the finetuning model and the no-transfer learning model. In this file we show example for fold1. Executing this file would give the finetune model for fold1. We need to change the fold numbers for running it for different folds.
2.	QDTL.py: contains the code for our approach. In the file we show example for fold1. Executing this file will give QDTL model on fold1.  We have to change the fold numbers for running this file for different folds. For example, we would have to change the name of models for each fold and the name of the final model.
